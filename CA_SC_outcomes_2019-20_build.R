# Sink can write to both the console and a text file if you write 'split = TRUE'.
# If you use the 'cat' command instead of 'print' command it doesn't have a number before it

# just want to paste something.
# Use sink() to stop the sink.

sink() # Just putting this here so that if I run it over again it doesn't create more and more sinks...
